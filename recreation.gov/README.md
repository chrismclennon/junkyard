# Recreation.gov Reservation Notifier

A super simple script that will check the recreation.gov site every minute and send a text when a reservation is open. Used to get me some awesome reservations that were otherwise booked out.

The script is currently written specifically for a Rocky Mountain National Park reservation, but can be easily tailored to a different park.
